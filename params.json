Click the '+'-button and choose the pipeline you want to generate test reports for. The system then retrieves all test files and creates graph and possible error table for all tests found in that pipeline. For now only cucumber tests are supported. If defined, the system will switch between monitor and test report page every `switchBetweenPagesInterval` seconds.\r\n\r\n![Test reports](https://github.com/karmats/gocd-monitor/blob/gh-pages/images/test-report.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n@karmats",
